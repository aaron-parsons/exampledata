The data in this directory are examples from the Advanced Photon Source.
They were collected by the EPICS sscan record 
	(http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/sscan/sscan.html)
	(http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/sscan/sscanDoc.html)
and saved in an APS format called MDA by the saveData software
	(http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/sscan/saveData_fileFormat.txt)

The data were then converted (much) later to NeXus HDF4 
files using the scan2nexus software
	(referenced indirectly at http://aps.anl.gov/bcda/dataVis/hdfb.html)

The data were then converted NeXus XML files using the nxconvert software
